This thesis presented a review of literature concerning microRNAs and
prediction of microRNA target genes. A Bayesian regression model was applied
to predict protein expression from mRNA and miRNA expression in breast
cancer tumor samples.

An obvious way to improve the model would be to include sequence based target
information. Bayesian modeling provides a formal and relatively easy
way to achieve this with hierarchical models. MicroRNAs that
that are putative regulators of a gene based on sequence could have
different (more slack) priors or superpriors than miRNAs without
seed sequence matches. Furthermore, experimentally validated regulators
could have different priors as well.

The proposed model also does not account for the fact that microRNAs have
several, even hundreds, of target transcripts. Therefore, the regulative
effect of a single miRNA is most likely spread across several genes. In combination
with transcripts having several regulating miRNAs, this many-to-many nature of
microRNA regulation ultimately calls for expression methods that model the
whole regulatory network at once. This, however, becomes a much more difficult
problem than simple multiple linear regression. \textbf{Akilla oli tähän joku

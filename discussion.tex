An obvious way to improve the model would be to include sequence based target
information. Bayesian modeling provides a formal and relatively easy
way to achieve this in the form of hierarchical models. MicroRNAs that
that are putative regulators of a gene based on sequence could have
different (more slack) priors or superpriors than miRNAs without
seed sequence matches. Furthermore, experimentally validated regulators
could have different priors as well.

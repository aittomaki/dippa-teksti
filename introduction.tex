Breast cancer is the most common of female cancers and causes remarkable
morbidity and mortality word-wide \citep{??}.  Annually more than 1.5 million
women develop breast cancer. Thus, breast cancer is a major global health
problem.

Cancer is a genetic disease caused by mutations in the genome of the cancer
cells. Some of these mutations can be inherited, while some are somatic, that
is, mutations that arise during the life-time of an individual in the tissue,
where cancer develops. To understand how cancer develops, the tumor evolution
of breast cancer, it is of paramount importance to identify genes in which
mutations initiate breast cancer development. It is already known that many of
these mutations perturb the expression of the gene in question. Previous
expression studies comparing the expression profiles of normal breast tissue
and breast cancer tissue have revealed ...

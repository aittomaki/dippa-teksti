\paragraph{MicroRNA function and role in disease}


Additionally, it has been
found that specific miRNA precursors, but not the mature miRNAs, are
consistently aberrantly expressed in some cancers, suggesting that the
precursors have some unidentified regulatory functions \citep{Calin2004}.

MicroRNAs themselves are regulated by several different mechanisms, similarly
to mRNA and gene expression. Possible control points include transcription of
genomic miRNAs, post-transcriptional modification of pri- and pre-miRNAs,
JATKA LISTAA. MiRNAs also form transcriptional feedback loops with proteins
that act as transcription factors (TFs) for miRNAs. For example, JOKU TÄHÄN JA
KUVA SIITÄ. Some of these regulation mechanisms have a known important
biological function, such as miR-XXX and miR-XXX which function as a cell fate
switch, determining the differentiation of ASF.

Dysregulation of microRNAs can happen at any of these putative regulation
steps, and many, if not all, of them have been implicated in tumorgenesis.
Examples of this include LISTAA. There are also additional mechanisms that can
lead to miRNA dysregulation, such as mutations in the miRNA sequence or the
target mRNA sequence, genomic rearrangements,
\textbf{LISÄÄ?}. The role of miRNAs in cancer has recently been
thoroughly reviewed by FOO-ET-AL \citep{CITE}.

It has also been shown in knock-out experiments that inhibiting the microRNA
biogenesis pathway is lethal in many species \citep{CITE} and, further, that
perturbing miRNA biogenesis often leads to tumor formation \citep{CITE}. This
highlights the importance of microRNAs and their regulatory function.

  \caption{Distributions of chosen model sizes for differrent values of model-size parameters $\alpha$ and $\gamma$.
  $\# 0$ refers to the number of models with no covariates (i.e. not even the mRNA covariate was chosen)
  and $\# \textup{NA}$ to the number of models where the model-size criterion was not met.
  The parameter values had a large impact on the final model sizes. Strict values
  ($\alpha$ close to one and small $\gamma$) generated very large models and had the
  effect of the size-criterion not being met for many genes (larger $\# \textup{NA}$).}

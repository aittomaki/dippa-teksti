\section{Research material and methods}\label{material-and-methods}

\subsection{Research material}

The data analysed in this thesis was collected from breast cancer patients treated
in two different Norwegian hospitals. All included cases of breast cancer were
of sporadic type and all patients were women. Alltogether 283 samples were analysed.

The mRNA and microRNA expression data are publicly available in preprocessed
format in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database \citep{GEO} under
accession IDs xx and xx respectively. The protein expression data is available
in Additional file 4 of \citet{norjis} also in preprocessed format. For the purpose of this
thesis, the raw Agilent expression data were kindly provided and used for the analyses instead of the preprocessed data.

Clinical data concerning each patient and cancer were also provided. A summary
of the clinical parameters is presented in table \ref{clinical-data}. The
predominant tumor type in the data was ductal carcinoma, which is in general
the most common histological type of breast cancer.

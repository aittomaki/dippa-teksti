\section{Research material and methods}\label{material-and-methods}

\subsection{Research material}

The data analysed in this thesis consisted of tumor samples from 283 breast
cancer patients treated in two Norwegian hospitals. Protein, mRNA and microRNA
expression were measured from each sample. The data were published by
\citet{Aure2015} and are publicly available.

The patients in the data are part of the OSLO2 cohort, the collection of which
started in 2006 and is still ongoing. Therefore, no survival data were
available for analysis. Clinical data for included patients is summarised in
Table \ref{clinical-data}. All included patients had primarily operable
disease, that is stage cT1-cT2. No control samples were available.

The mRNA and microRNA expression were measured using Agilent Technologies
SurePrint G3 Human GE 8x60K and Human miRNA Microarray Kit (V2), respectively,
which contain 27958 genes and 887 miRNAs according to manufacturer annotation.
Protein expression was measured using a reverse phospatase protein array
(RPPA) containing a set of 105 proteins, most of which are found on the PI3K-
pathway \textbf{ref to G.Mills?}. Only the gene expression values
corresponding to each measured protein were used in the analysis. Analyses
performed in this thesis used the publicly available preprocessed data
\textbf{paitsi jos ehtii tehä vielä preprocin ite}.

MicroRNAs detected in less than 10\% of samples had been removed from the
publicly available OSLO2 data, leaving 421 miRNAs. Out of these, eleven miRNAs
(hsa-miR-1274a, hsa-miR-1274b, hsa-miR-1280, hsa-miR-1308, hsa- miR-1826, hsa-
miR-1974, hsa-miR-1975, hsa-miR-1977, hsa-miR-1979, hsa-miR-720, hsa-
miR-886-3p) were reported as missing by miRBase Tracker. Reviewed on miRBase,
these miRNAs are reported as being fragments of other RNA species (e.g. tRNA
or rRNA) and, thus, not actual miRNAs and removed from the database.
Therefore, these eleven miRNAs were removed from subsequent analyses.




% The mRNA and microRNA expression data are publicly available in preprocessed
% format in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database \citep{GEO} under
% accession IDs xx and xx respectively. For the purpose of this thesis, the raw
% Agilent expression data were kindly provided and used for the analyses instead
% of the preprocessed data. The protein expression data is available in
% Additional file 4 of \citet{norjis} also in preprocessed format.

% Clinical data concerning each patient and cancer were also provided. A summary
% of the clinical parameters is presented in table \ref{clinical-data}. The
% predominant tumor type in the data was ductal carcinoma, which is in general
% the most common histological type of breast cancer.

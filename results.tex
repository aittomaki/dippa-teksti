\begin{itemize}
  \item QC plots
  \begin{itemize}
    \item distributions of arrays
    \item PCA and hierarch. clust of samples with hospital colors
  \end{itemize}
  \item correlation plots
  \begin{itemize}
    \item mRNA-protein
    \item miRNA-mRNA (target vs non-target)
    \item miRNA-protein (target vs non-target)
    \item all three combined (additionally with grouping by intrinsic subtype?)
  \end{itemize}
  \item cross-validation results
  \begin{itemize}
    \item example plots of search path ("good" and "bad")
  \end{itemize}
  \item miRNA coefficients from final models
  \begin{itemize}
  	\item plot of different threshold values
    \item number of miRNAs included
    \item percentage of significant coefs
    \item percentage predicted by seq algos (num miRNAs vs num algos, included vs significant)
    \item percentage validated in experiments (included vs significant, mirTarBase)
  \end{itemize}
  \item simple network analysis?
  \begin{itemize}
    \item connections between included miRNAs and genes
    \item some pathway analysis or geneset enrichment? (moot since proteins from PIK3-path?)
  \end{itemize}
  \item DE analysis of included/significant miRNAs?
  \begin{itemize}
    \item triple negative cancers vs others
    \item alternatively correlations between significant miRNAs-proteins grouped by intrinsic subtypes?
  \end{itemize}
